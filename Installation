| Thanks, Ashish Singh. Let's cover a couple of quick housekeeping items before we begin our first
| lesson. First of all, you should know that when you see '...', that means you should press Enter
| when you are done reading and ready to continue.

...  <-- That's your cue to press Enter to continue

| Also, when you see 'ANSWER:', the R prompt (>), or when you are asked to select from a list, that
| means it's your turn to enter a response, then press Enter to continue.

Select 1, 2, or 3 and press Enter 

1: Continue.
2: Proceed.
3: Let's get going!

Selection: 1

| You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc key. If you are
| already at the prompt, type bye() to exit and save your progress. When you exit properly, you'll
| see a short message letting you know you've done so.

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

| Let's get started!
